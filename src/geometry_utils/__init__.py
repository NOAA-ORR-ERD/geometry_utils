"""
geometry package

This package has a collection of computional geometry routines

These routines are all designed to work with simple data types:

Python floats
numpy arrays

For the most parts, regular python sequences (lists, tuples) will be
converted to Python arrays for you when required.

i.e. a polygon is expressed as a Nx2 numpy array of float64

Some of these are in Cython for speed.
